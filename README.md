# 02 Advanced CSS: My Portfolio

## Description
This portifolio has been developed using inspiration of both a study group I had setup, and the example provided as a part of the assesment.

It certainly highlighted how important CSS and HTML are, and how vital their mutual relationship.

## Usage
This website was created using a combination of VS Code and Dev Tools (Chrome).

This is meant to be a canva for a novel coder like myself to start honing their skills and add their expereinces as they become more confident.

Here, you will see how the website looks on larger screens.



In the “header”, one will be able to navigate to the corresponding sections by clicking on them (About me, Work, Contact me). Below, you'll find the developer profile picture and description of the puspose of the website.




The "About Me" section in the body is meant to tell the story of the dev.



The "Work" sections highlights the dev previous work. In my case, only a couple of basic/small projects (for now!).
Clicking on them will take the user to its relative webpage.


Last but not least, the "Contact Me" section at the bottom displayes the dev contact details and Social Media handles.




## Development & Deployment
This website is programmed using Responsive Design, allowing content to be resized, shrunk, or moved to fit the needs of the user's screen.


As shown, '@media screen (min-width)' was used in this project to develop it for small screens and then scale it for larger screens.

As always, it is important to specify meta elements in the HTML correctly to link HTML and CSS, and also ensure that the page has the required responsive design. Also important to add alt description to images for accessibility/SEO purposes.
